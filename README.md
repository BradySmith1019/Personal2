Welcome App shows the daily weather on computer startup as well as the flavor of the day at Culver's. I've used it to experiment with interacting with web APIs and web scraping. It also collects various weather data and puts it into a database for data analysis. The intent of Auto Sentencer was to practice SQL and database structure, and is largely unfinished.
